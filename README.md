## My process

### Built with

- [Astro](https://astro.build/) - Astro is a new kind of static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance with modern dev tools.
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

- First time I used Astro, it was a good experience. I really liked the way it works. Looking forward to use it in future projects.

- Styling with tailwindCSS is fast, However Developer experience is not that good. Specially, when I left the project for a while and came back to it, I had a hard time figuring out what is going on in the code, and the HTML code looks awful with all the classes. I think I may consider going back to vanilla CSS with BEM convention for my next project.

- Planning before coding is a must. I had to change the HTML structure multiple times during the project, which was a waste of time. Having a kanban board with all the tasks would have been a better approach.

### Continued development

- Learning advanced Grid techniques. Mastering layout design is the key for a faster development.

- Learning more about semantic HTML.

- Learning more about accessibility.
- Learning about component animation and transitions for a better user experience.
- Writing a better README file.
